House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. 
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

Welcome to the most challening dataset for a beginer in the ML world. The Boston House Prediction.

Link for the Problem Statement -> https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

We take up on this challenge with an extensive EDA, Since this is a previous version without feature Engineering I shall commit the newer one later.

But nevertheless this notebook will guide you through the problem with EDA, Data-PreProcessing, Data Visualization, Model Creation and Model Evaluation.

Not a Surprise that with feature engineering out model performs v poop on traditional methods like Logistic and SVC.

With ensemble techniques like XGBoost, because of its iterative approach and gradient descent we are successfully able to get the accuracy we need, moreover it is the rmse that is worth noticing. Happy Learning
